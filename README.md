# Projection-Mapping
This repository is to store and keep updated the projection mapping for the RPI Players production of Sweeney Todd. This project will be used to projection map onto a set. This program currently uses Touch Designer to projection map. I will look into other ways to map, but this currently looks like the best idea. There is an easy to use a library in Touch Designer called kantan mapper which makes projection mapping simple. You can find more information about kantan mapper [here](https://docs.derivative.ca/Palette:kantanMapper) This project will most likely be controlled through Qlab

## Touch Designer & Kantan Mapper
I have decided to currently use 4 kantan mappers in the project. One for each wall and one to combine them all. I believe this will make it easiest to combine the video clips; however, I am also debating making one video for each wall in another program like [davinci resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)  and then using one kantan mapper to combine the videos.

## Control
This program is currently being designed to be controlled through Qlab. Thouch Designer can output videos and Qlab will be able to play them. The only issue is connecting the projector to the computer. This will most likely be completed using hdmi extenders
